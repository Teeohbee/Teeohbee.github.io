An eager junior web developer. After a successful four year career in accounting, I wanted to explore a new career path that would utilise both a logical and creative mindset. Having completed an intense twelve week coding bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), I have fallen for the charms of coding and software development.

I understand that I am only at the beginning of a long and arguably infinite journey into the depths of the coding world - trying to understand programming concepts, master new languages and hone my craft.

Looking forward to writing and sharing the trials, tribulations and revelations along the way.
