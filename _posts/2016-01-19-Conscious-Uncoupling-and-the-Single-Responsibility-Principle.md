title: Conscious Uncoupling and the Single Responsibility Principle
---

> *A class should have only one reason to change* - Robert C. Martin, 2003

I've been reading a fair bit about the single responsibility principle recently, in refreshing my knowledge of Object Oriented Design and the SOLID design principles. In essence, the explanation of the single responsibility principle, henceforth referred to as SRP, is a simple one, it's in adhering to, and maintaining, the principle in your code that which things get tricky.

The simplest explanation is that in general every class, or module of code, should only ever have one 'job' - be responsible for only one aspect of functionality in the software.
